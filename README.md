Dancing Doves
=============

Made for CISC 221 - Assignment 1 - Winter 2014 at Queen's University

Compile with gcc (assembly is ARM only) and run

    gcc dancing-doves.c -o dancing-doves
    ./dancing-doves

press `<ENTER>` a lot.

It's fun

Use the `bot.sh` script to watch a super-advanced AI play the game

    ./bot.sh | ./dancing-doves
